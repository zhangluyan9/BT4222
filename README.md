# BT4222 sentiment analysis

This code provide 3 different kinds of embedding methods+ pure CNN baseline (Acc 55.03), pure LSTM (Acc 56.33), pure MLP (Acc 52.11). We also provide how to increase the model accuracy by playing with model structure. We provide CNN+LSTM (Acc 56.58), voting rule with CNN and LSTM (Acc 56.42) and CNN+LSTM+FC+Attention layer (Acc 55.04 May be the problem of overfitting).

All models structure and design methods are from state-of-art papers. We provide the paper name and link withion code.

# What to do next 

I will further add more detailed comments/figures.
